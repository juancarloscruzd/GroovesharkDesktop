					Yo man)<br>
					Yo<br>
					(Open up man)<br>
					What do you want man?<br>
					(My girl just caught me)<br>
					You let her catch you?<br>
					(I don't know how I let this happen)<br>
					With who?<br>
					(The girl next door, you know?) Man...<br>
					(I don't know what to do)<br>
					Say it wasn't you<br>
					(Alright)<br>
					<br>
					Honey came in and she caught me red-handed<br>
					Creeping with the girl next door<br>
					Picture this we were both butt-naked<br>
					Banging on the bathroom floor<br>
					How could I forget<br>
					That I had given her an extra key<br>
					All this time she was standing there<br>
					She never took her eyes off me<br>
					<br>
					How you can grant the woman access to your villa<br>
					Trespasser and a witness while you cling on your pillow<br>
					You better watch your back before she turn into a killer<br>
					Best for you and the situation not to call the beaner<br>
					To be a true player you have to know how to play<br>
					If she say you're not, convince her say you're gay<br>
					Never admit to a word when she say makes a claim<br>
					And you tell her baby no way<br>
					<br>
					But she caught me on the counter<br>
					(It wasn't me)<br>
					Saw me banging on the sofa<br>
					(It wasn't me)<br>
					I even had her in the shower<br>
					(It wasn't me)<br>
					She even caught me on camera<br>
					(It wasn't me)<br>
					She saw the marks on my shoulder<br>
					(It wasn't me)<br>
					Heard the words that I told her<br>
					(It wasn't me)<br>
					Heard the screams getting louder<br>
					(It wasn't me)<br>
					She stayed until it was over<br>
					<br>
					Honey came in and she caught me red-handed<br>
					Creeping with the girl next door<br>
					Picture this we were both butt-naked<br>
					Banging on the bathroom floor<br>
					How could I forget<br>
					That I had given her an extra key<br>
					All this time she was standing there<br>
					She never took her eyes off me<br>
					<br>
					I had tried to keep her from what she was about to see<br>
					Why should she believe me when I told her it wasn't me<br>
					<br>
					Make sure she knows it's not you and lead her on<br>
					Da right prefix whenever you should<br>
					see her make da giggolo flex<br>
					As funny as it be by you, it not that complex<br>
					Seein' is believin' so you better change your specs<br>
					You know she not gonna be worrying<br>
					bout things from the past<br>
					Hardly recollecting and then she'll go to noontime mass<br>
					Your answer: go over there but if she pack a gun<br>
					You know you better run fast<br>
					<br>
					But she caught me on the counter<br>
					(It wasn't me)<br>
					Saw me banging on the sofa<br>
					(It wasn't me)<br>
					I even had her in the shower<br>
					(It wasn't me)<br>
					She even caught me on camera<br>
					(It wasn't me)<br>

					She never took her eyes off me<br>
					<br>
					How could I forget<br>
					That I had given her an extra key<br>
					All this time she was standing there<br>
					She never took her eyes off me<br>
					Gonna tell her that I'm sorry for the pain that I've caused<br>
					I've been listenin' to your reasonin'<br>
					It makes no sense at all<br>
					We should tell her that I'm sorry for the pain that I've caused<br>
					You may think that you're a player<br>
					But you're completely lost<br>
					<br>
					Honey came in and she caught me red-handed<br>
					Creeping with the girl next door<br>
					Picture this we were both butt-naked<br>
					Banging on the bathroom floor<br>
					How could I forget<br>
